# Auxiliary variables

## Topics

- counters 
  
- accumulators

- trailers


# Counters

---

A variable, normally of type integer, that is incremented as we *parse* an iterable

Example: compute list size/lenght

```python
l = 0

for f in fruits:

  l = l +1

print(f'The lenght of list {fruits} is {l}')
```

. . . 

Syntax: `l += 1` is shorthand for `l = l + 1`


--- 

## Anonymous variables

In fact, we are not operating on `f`

it can be omitted in favour of an *anonymous variable* `_`

```python
l = 0

for _ in fruits:

  l += 1

print(f'The lenght of list {fruits} is {l}')
```


# Accumulators


---

A variable to record quantities seen during the iteration

Example: the average of an arbitrary list of positive numbers


```python
l = 0
accumulator = 0

for val in mylist:
  l += 1
  accumulator += val

if l > 0:
  average =  accumulator / l # this will be a float

print(f'There are {l} values and their average is {average}')
```


# Trailing variables

---

A variable that *remembers* past values during an iteration

Example: find the biggest *temperature increase* in a list 

```python
maxincrease = 0

trailer = temperaturelist[0]

for temp in temperaturelist:

  current_increase = temp - trailer
  
  if current_increase > maxincrease:
    maxincrease = current_increase # a new max is found

  # we are finished with this value, assign it to the trailer
  trailer = temp

print(f'The maximum day-on-day increase has been {maxincrease} degrees')
```


---

## Programme comprehension

To grasp how trailers work, put extra `print()` commands to see what the variables contain

Rename variables:


```python
yesterday = temperaturelist[0]

for today in temperaturelist:

  current_increase = today - yesterday

  ...

  yesterday =  today
```

---

## A more complete encoding

```python
temperaturelist = [12, 16, 18, 16, 19, 18, 20, 21]

max_difference = 0

yesterday = temperaturelist[0]

for today in temperaturelist:

  current_temp_difference = abs(today - yesterday)

  if current_temp_difference > max_difference:
      max_difference = current_temp_difference

  yesterday =  today
  
print(max_difference)
```

## Quiz

Complete code for searching a given number in a sequence

```python
KEY = 22

mylist = [1, 6, 3, 9, 10]

___ item ___ mylist:
  if ___ == ___:
    found = True
  else:
    found = False
```
