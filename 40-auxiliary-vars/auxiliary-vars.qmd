# Auxiliary variables and Loops


## Topics

- counters 
  
- accumulators

- trailers


---

## Exercise, b: solution

Print available fruits but stop as soon as you find bananas

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'blackcurrant']
```

should only print ``apple``

. . . 

```python
for f in fruits:

  if f == 'banana':
    break

  else:
    print(f)
```

# Counters

---

A variable, normally of type integer, that is incremented as we *parse* an iterable

Example: compute list size/lenght

```python
l = 0

for f in fruits:
  l = l +1

print(f'The lenght of list {fruits} is {l}')
```

. . . 

Syntax: ``l += 1`` is shorthand for ``l = l + 1``


--- 

## Anonymous variables

In fact, we are not operating on ``f``

it can be omitted in favour of an *anonymous variable* ``_``

```python
l = 0

for _ in fruits:
  l += 1

print(f'The lenght of list {fruits} is {l}')
```


# Accumulators


---

A variable to record quantities seen during the iteration

Example: compute the average of an arbitrary list of positive numbers


```python
l = 0
accumulator = 0

for val in mylist:
  l += 1
  accumulator += val

average =  accumulator / l # this will be a float

print(f'There are {l} values and their average is {average}')
```


# Trailing variables

---

A variable that 'remembers' past values during an iteration

Example: record the biggest temperature increase ever seen in the list 

```python
maxincrease = 0

trailer = temperaturelist[0]

for temp in temperaturelist:

  current_increase = temp - trailer
  
  if current_increase > maxincrease:
    maxincrease = current_increase # a new max is found

  # we are finished with this value, assign it to the trailer
  trailer = temp

print(f'The maximum day-on-day increase has been {maxincrease} degrees')
```


---

## Programme comprehension

To grasp how trailers work, put extra ``print()`` commands to see what the variables contain

Rename variables:


```python
yesterday = temperaturelist[0]

for today in temperaturelist:

  current_increase = today - yesterday

  ...

  yesterday =  today
```

## Quiz

Complete code for searching a given number in a sequence

```python
KEY = 22

mylist = [1, 6, 3, 9, 10]

___ item ___ mylist:
  if ___ == ___:
    found = True
  else:
    found = False
```
