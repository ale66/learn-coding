# Functions

![](./imgs/function-as-blackbox.png)


---

Functions are a key abstraction to model nature and processes

a regular input/output or cause/effect behaviour is identified and *given a name*

```text
The higher the temperature the quicker the veggies cook.

Cooking time is a function of the temperature in the oven.
```

---

## Functions in coding

A function is a block of code that 

- has a clear input/output definition and 

- executes in a separated environment

. . .

```python
def marks2pc(marks: int):
  ''' Convert Italian exam marks into percentages '''
  
  pc = int((marks / 30) * 100)

  return pc
```

`marks` is a *parameter* of the f.

`pc` is the *return value* of the f.

---

## Observations

Functions only run when they are called ('invoked') within a code in execution

```python
for m in my_italian_exam_marks:
  uk_marks = marks2pc(m)
  print(uk_marks)
```

Functions should be defined every time a block of code is required to appear more than once: 

- improve readability

- improve maintainance


# Syntax

```bnf
def <name>(<parameter(s)>):
  return <output(s)>
```

---

## Kinds of functions:

- __built-in:__ come with Python, e.g., `input()`, `print()`, `float()`, `int()` etc.
  
- __methods:__ come with types, e.g., `mylist.len()`, `mylist.append('a')`
  
- __external__ are *imported* into the code upon demand (more later)

- __defined__ we define then use them

Names of the built-in functions are reserved: avoid them as variable names


---

## Multiple parameters and arguments

- functions can take two or more arguments, and even an arbitrary number of them

- mapping arguments to parameters is done by position

- it is also possible to return multiple arguments
 
```python
first_out, second_out =  func(first_in, second_in)

def func(primero, segundo):

  # ...

  return tercero, quarto
```

what are the bindings?


---

## Multiple inputs example

Given a text and a character, count the number of occurrences of it 

```python
def char_counter(text, c):
  '''returns the number of times we found c in text'''

  # this cannot be empty
  pass
```

---

## Function nesting example

```python
def find_tendencies(my_temperatures_list):
    '''
      Nested function calls
    '''

    l = len(my_temperatures_list)

    if l > 0:
        min_val = min(my_temperatures_list)
        max_val = max(my_temperatures_list)
        avg_val = sum(my_temperatures_list) / l
        
        # Return multiple values separated by commas (creates a tuple)
        return min_val, max_val, avg_val, l

    else:
      print('Empty temperature list, defaulting to None')
      return None, None, None, 0
```

---

## Visibility rules are enforced

Why is this giving error?

```python
first_out, second_out =  func(first_in, second_in)

def func(primero, segundo):

  # print(f'inside here, primero is really first_in: {primero} = {first_is}')

  return tercero, quarto
```

---

## A version with types

Expliciting data types helps in catching coding errors as soon as possible

```python
def char_counter(text: str, c: chr) -> int:
  '''returns the number of times we found c in text'''

  # this cannot be empty
  pass
```

---

## Nesting

The  __return__  value of a f. could be the  __input parameter__  to another

![](./imgs/nesting.png)

```python
def square(x):
  return x**2

def average_of_three(x, y, z):
  return (x+y+z)/3

print(average_of_three(square(10), square(20), square(30)))
```

---

## `void` functions

Functions may *not* return a value 

```python
def greet(lang):

  if lang == 'es':
    print('Hola')

  elif lang == 'fr':
    print('Bonjour')

  else:
    print('Hello')

greet('es')
```

they don't need to be to the right of an assignment symbol

---


## Further observations

An *argument* is what the caller code sends to the function, e.g., `'es'` in the example

A *parameter* is the local (to the function) given value, e.g., `lang` in the example

Remember: functions are executed in a container and only *see* their parameters, not the variables and values of the calling code
