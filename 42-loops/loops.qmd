# Loops


---

## The ``While`` instruction

We saw ``for`` to *iterate* over a sequence

A block of code is executed as many times as the number of elements of the sequence

```python
writers = ['Hemingway', 'Dickens', 'King']

for w in writers:
  print(w)
```


---

__With the while loop we execute a block only as long as a given expression is true_ 

```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
``` 

increment is not automatic

the expression is evaluated *before* executing the block of code

Try the example above on [pythontutor.com](https://pythontutor.com/)


---


With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

```python
i = 1
while i < 6:
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1
``` 


---

## Indefinite loops

Would execute forever, or until a break condition is met

```python
while True:
  
  command = input(''Please enter a command, type 'exit' to stop.'')
  
  if command == 'exit':
    break
  else:
    # implement commands here ..
``` 


---

What is this code doing?

```python
n = 5

while n > 0 :

      print(n)

      n = n-1   # or n -= 1

print('Blastoff!')
```

---

## Quiz: What's wrong with this loop?


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
```python
n = 10

while n > 0 :
      print('Hi')

print('End')
```
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](./imgs/timer.gif){width=80%}
:::

::::

. . .

Execution won't end as $n$ is never decreased


# Indefinite loops

---

- some `while` loops are called *indefinite* because they keep going until a logical condition becomes false

- but will it ever happen?
  
- codes seen so far are easy to examine to see whether they will terminate or become  *infinite*

- termination analysis is about checking, *before running it,* that our code will always reach the final nstruction and control will be back to the operating system

- this activity cannot be automated


# `for` vs. `while`

---

Use `for` to automate work over collections, here represented by iterables 

In principle, all elements will be examined

Use `while` to search for a specific element: it stops as soon as it's found

Also use `while` or to act *conditionally* and stop as soon as the condition is not true anymore


---

## ``while`` in lists

```python
my_list = [1, 3, 7, 9]

count = 0 # will work as index

while(True):
      print(my_list[count])

      if (count == len(my_list) - 1):
          print("end")
          break

      count += 1
```

. . .

```python
for n in my_list:
        print(n)
```
