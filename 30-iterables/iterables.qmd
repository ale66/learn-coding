# Data Structures


## Abstraction

In CS all efforts are made to create -abstractions- of computers/memory that let us program them easily and in a -portable- way

Data structures are presentations of our data that support our coding


---

## So far

- variables as name/type/value triples 

- a version of Spreadsheet cells

- *scalar* or *atomic* datum


---

## Today

- variables as name/type/structure/values

- a version of spreadsheet columns (or rows)

- multi-dimensional data

- an indexing systems allows to reach each single value


---

- The way in which the data is organized guides coding and affects computation
  
- data structures are a _design choice_ based on:
  - the nature of the data
  - the processes that need to be performed

- Python offers simple data structures, their adoption affects code readability as well as scalability.


# Lists

---

## The basic structure for non-atomic data

List: a sequence (order matters) of zero, one or more data items

lists are visualised as 

- a contiguous block of memory locations, 

- each of them storing a fixed-length data item.

---
  
- used to store multiple, oft. homogeneous data in a single variable

- any data type and combinations of data types

- the elements of a list are indexed 

- such indexing starts from 0

---

## Properties of lists

- can be ordered
  
- values are changeable
  
-  duplicated data items are allowed


---

## Quiz 1! True or False? 

![](./imgs/iterables2.gif)

  - A list is an *ordered* and *changeable* collection of data where we can only store data of the same data type.

  - We use the index of a list to access elements, and these indexes represent the actual addresses of contiguous memory locations.

  - Since lists are indexed, they may contain repeated values.


---

  - A Python list is an ordered and  hangeable collection of data where we can only store data of the same data type.

    - **False, we can store data of different types**
 
  - We use the index of a list to access elements, and this index number is the actual address of a memory block.
  
    - **False, indexes represent the memory addresses, but always start from 0**
 
  - Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value.

    - **True!**


# Work with lists

---

## A list of strings

A simple list of London football clubs

```python
teams = ['Chelsea FC', 'Arsenal FC', 'Crystal Palace FC', 'West Ham FC']
```

Its lenght is the number of items it contains:

```python
len(teams)
4
```

---

## Access by index

```python
print(teams[0])

Chelsea FC
```

```python
print(teams[3])

West Ham FC
```

---

```python
if (teams[0] == 'Chelsea FC'):

      print('Come on Chelsea!')
```

---

## Mutable values

```python
fruitlist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print(fruitlist)
```

```python
# Update a value
fruitlist[1] = 'blackcurrant' 

print(fruitlist)
```

---

## A brief on *methods*

They are automatically attached to a var.

`my_var.built_in_method()`

which methods are attached depends on the var. type

For list vars. much is available:

# Strings

---

## Python strings are lists

```python
mystring = 'python'
```

| p  | y  | t  | h  | o  | n  |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
| -6 | -5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 |

```python
print(mystring[0])
```

```python
print(mystring[-1])
```

---

## Slicing

We can access arbitrary segments of the list/string:

```python
alist = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]

print(alist[0:2]) 
```

*N.B.:* intervals are closed on the left and open on the right!

elements in position 0 & 1 are printed, position 2 ain't

---

## Quiz 2! True or False? 

![](./imgs/iterables3.gif)

```python
mydata = [12, 32, 1, 43, 65]
```

Does

- a) `print(mydata[3])` print 1?

- b) `print(mydata[1]+18` print 50?

- c) `print(mydata[-1])` print 65?

- d) `print(mydata[0:3])` print [12, 32, 1]?

---

## Solutions

- a: False
- b: True
- c: True
- d: True


# Iterations

---

## iterables

Python lists are called *iterables* because they are likely subjects or the repetition (iteration) of a fixed sequence of instructions

```text
# print the content of the string var. vertically:
# each letter on a separate line.
```

```python
for letter in mystring:
    print(letter) 
    # a 'newline' is automatically emitted at the end of each print()
```

as with `if`, the 4-spaces indentation defines blocks of code 

blocks may be exectued zero, one or many times.

---

## unhelpful...

```python
print(mystring[0])
print(mystring[1])
print(mystring[2])
...
```

---

Inflation! Raise all prices in the menu by 10pc

```python
alist = [2, 3, 5, 7]

# fix me!
for price in alist:
    price = price*1.1
    print(f'The new price is {price}')
```

We need to amend each element of the existing list, as in 

```python
  alist[0] = alist[0]*1.1
```

but when to stop?


---

## Range 

A function that generates the indices needed to amend the list element by element

```python
range(5) = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

implictly starts from 0 to enumerate up to

```python
range(3, 6) = 3, 4, 5
```

an interval

```python
range(3, 8, 2) = 3, 5, 7 # +2 at each step
```

---

## Example

```python
alist = [2, 3, 5, 7]

howmany = len(alist)

for i in range(howmany):
    # prices are changed forever
    alist[i] = alist[i]*1.1
```

---

## Exercise:

```python
teams = ['Chelsea FC', 'Arsenal FC', 'Crystal Palace FC', 'West Ham FC']
```

print out the club names without the ` FC` suffix

## Exercise, a

Print available fruits but not bananas

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'blackcurrant']
```

hint: use `continue`

---

## Exercise, b

Print available fruits but stop as soon as you find bananas

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'blackcurrant']
```

hint: use``break`
