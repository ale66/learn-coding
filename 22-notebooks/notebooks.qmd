- Step-by-step execution, inside a browser or an IDE

- code is broken up into segments called __cells__
  
- each cell is like a mini-program, after which we can suspend the execution to evaluate the intermediate results

- code cells are often interleaved with explanatory text/diagrams written in the *Markdown annotation language.*

- a *notebook* is a special file in Jupyter format, with extension *.ipynb*


# Kernels

## kernels

- an interpreter that runs in the background of a notebook
 
- a Jupyter extensions brokers our code to the kernel piecemeal
  
- step-by-step execution

- intermediate data is kept inside the jupyter browser

## Simple text mark-up/decoration

Simple annotations to the text guide the creation of HTML (web page) displays

More complex effects are obtained by *embedding*

- HTML code for formatting
  
- LaTeX code for mathematics

double underscores for __boldface:__ 

```md
__boldface:__ 
```

stars for *italics:*

```markdown
*italics:*
```

A dash followed by space for lists:

```markdown
- HTML code for formatting
```

Hash symbols for titles:

```markdown
# Big title

## A bit smaller

###### tiny title
```
