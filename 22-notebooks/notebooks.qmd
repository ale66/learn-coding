## Step-by-step

- we still need to access an interpreter
 
- the browser will broker our code piecemeal to the interpreter, then come back to us and print the results

- unlike traditional Py. execution, intermediate data is kept inside the browser's own memory

- Sequences of instructions to be executed together are __cells__.

- code cells are often interleaved with explanatory text/diagrams written in the *Markdown annotation language.*
