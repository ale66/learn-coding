## Install components

### Install needed components

These operations often require *admin* access.

For Win: start ``Windows PowerShell`` with rigth-clik+'Run as admin'

For iOs: start ``Terminal`` then ``su``

For Linux: you don't need me :smile:

These installations may require time. 

For a quick start, use the [online VS Code tool](https://vscode.dev/)

---

#### Python

<img src="./imgs/python.png" height="150">

* install from [www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)

* no need for Anaconda virtual env. (yet)

---

#### VS Code

<img src="./imgs/vscode.png" height="300">

* Free and light

* lots of extensions allow customisation

---

###### VS Code Extensions

<img src="./imgs/vscode-extensions.png" height="120">

__CTRL+Shift+x__ to the markeplace

* Python, by Microsoft

* Jupyter, by Microsoft

* Markdown All-in-one

* Simple CSV editor

---

#### PIP

an external command for your Terminal/Powershell

fetch+install *packages* containing Py. functions

Python extensively relays on packages

Get __get-pip.py__ from [the PIP web site](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

```bash
> wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```

```bash
> python get-pip.py
```

---

### Get essential modules

```bash
> pip install os
...
> pip install numpy
...
> pip install pandas
...
> pip install matplotlib
```

---

## App management

* for Win: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

* for iOs: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)


---

#### [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

<img src="./imgs/chocolatey.png" height="180">

It manages installed software as linux does

Intallation is of average complexity

Start a __PowerShell__ in administrator mode;

see ['individual installation'](https://chocolatey.org/install#individual).

---

##### Example commands

```bash
> choco install python
```

```bash
> choco install vscode
```

```bash
> choco install pip
```

```bash
> choco upgrade python
```

```bash
# upgrade all installed packages
> choco upgrade all --yes
```

---

#### [Home Brew](https://brew.sh/)

<img src="./imgs/homebrew.png" height="180">


Essentially the same as Chocolatey, but for MacOS.

```bash
> brew --cask install visual-studio-code
```

---

#### Further tips

* try practicing daily, in your __zone__

* try getting past frustation and *enjoy* the progress you make: you are in control now

* sign up to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to find solutions

* *do not,* at any rate, watch Python videos on YouTube...
