# Python modules

---

- functions allow to write a coherent, reusable code in isolation

- a *module* allows writing a coherent, reusable set of functions in isolation


---

- a module is a `.py` file that sits either locally or in designated locations controlled by the Python interpreter
  
- `pip` manages the designated locations and installs new modules
  
- an inclusion mechanism makes functions from a module file be listed in the *function space* of the program

# Useful Python modules

## Math

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="35%"}
  ```python
  import math

  mynum = 10

  # This will print 3.16
  print(math.sqrt(mynum))
  ```
:::
:::{.column width="65%"}

## RE

Support text parsing an manipulation

Example: find UK cell phone numbers, e.g., +44-7-449-001020, in a text

```python
import re

PATTERN = r'+44-7-\d{3}-\d{6}'

my_text = "..."

phone = re.search(PATTERN, my_text)

if phone:
    print("First phone no.:", phone.group())
```

---

## CSV

Useful to import data files into our variables

Examples are in the 'files' lecture


# Random numbers

---

* Why we need random numbers?
  * Testing!
  
  * Generating test datasets

* Aside from obvious applications like gambling or creating unpredictable scenarios in a computer game, randomness is important for Cryptography

* Cryptography requires numbers that attackers *can't guess*

## Random numbers (cont.)

Are only pseudo-random

all languages have a dedicated module: crucial in several activities

Python implements [Mersenne twisters](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-numbers-in-python/); `numpy` has PCG64

```python
import random

# what does it print?
my_random_num = random.randint(1, 10)

print(my_random_num)
print(my_random_num)
print(my_random_num)
```

---


```python
import random

r1, r2, r3 = random.randint(1, 10), random.randint(1, 10), random.randint(1, 10)

print(r1)
print(r2)
print(r3)
```


---

```python
import random

alist = list()

for i in range(10):

  alist.append(random.randint(1, 10))

  print(alist)

[7, 3, 6, 6, 7, 5, 3, 3, 5, 5]
```


---

## The random module


```python
from random import *

# Generate a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1
print(random())

# Pick a random number between 1 and 100
print(randint(1, 100))

# Shuffle the list items
items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(shuffle(items))

# Pick 4 random items from the list
print(sample(items, 4))
```

---

## Seeding random generators

* sometimes the pseudo-random sequence should be repeated for debuggin or validation

* The seed value is important in cyber-security to pseudo-randomly generate a strong secret encryption key.

* by re-using a custom seed value, we can initialize the strong pseudo-random number generator the way we want.


---

```python
import random

random.seed(1)

alist = list() # or []

for i in range(10):
  alist.append(random.randint(1, 10))

print(alist)
[3, 10, 2, 5, 2, 8, 8, 8, 7, 4]
```

This always prints the same sequence

---

```python
random.seed(1)

alist = list() # or []

for i in range(10):
  alist.append(random.randint(1, 10))

print(alist)
#--------------
random.seed(2)

# empty out the list
alist = list()

for i in range(10):
  alist.append(random.randint(1, 10))

print(alist)

[3, 10, 2, 5, 2, 8, 8, 8, 7, 4]
[1, 2, 2, 6, 3, 5, 5, 10, 4, 10]
```
