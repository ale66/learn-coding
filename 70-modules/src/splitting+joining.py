sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt. \
Solve metus; feret haec aliquam tibi fama salutem."

translation = "Here, too, the praiseworthy has its rewards; \
there are tears for things and mortal things touch the mind. \
Release your fear; this fame will bring you some safety."

# split it into separate words. 
# Here '.' and ' ' are the delimiters 
# TO DO: add ';'

    # test: does the sentence start with uppercase?

        # do nothing, the word is fine as it is
        occurence = word
