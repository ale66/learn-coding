## Elevator pitch

- introduce coding and Python

- focus on simple ways to develop software autonomously

- We will learn programming with Python!

---

- If time allows: basic Data Science methods 

  - Data types and data structures
  - Conditional and loops
  - User input output
  - Text files
  - Functions
  - Data cleaning
  - Basic stats
  - Relational databases and their Structured query language \(SQL\)

---

## On module completion you will be able to:

- Write Python programs

- start personal projects

- Understand the basics of algorithms and coding

- Use different data sources

- Visualize data

- use the SQL language to query relational databases; set up and run simple databases
