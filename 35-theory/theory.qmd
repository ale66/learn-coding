## PAC: the Problem-Algorithm-Code triad

---

## Motivations

- coding is often *problem solving + computer knowledge*

- we have worked on simple coding tasks: never in doubt about what was the desired result

- coding was essentially getting the computer to execute the right sequence of steps. 

- but what if the solution is itself complex?


## The Separation of Concerns

Take problem solving with computers and break it down into three layers

Work out the layers separately; different teams might work on each layer

Replication is possible


# Computational Problem

---

Identify the problem as an abstract input/output activity.

This the *what* of problem solving

---

## Example, I

Problem: __MAX__

__Instance:__ a sequence of $n$ integer numbers $a_1 \dots a_n$

__Solution:__ element $a_M$ such that $a_M \ge a_i$ for each element $a_i$ of the sequence.

---

Algorithm: __enumeration__

```text
input: sequence A
set a new variable M = 0

for each element a of A:
    if a > M then:
        set M = a

output: M
```

---


## Observations

- the formulation is abstract from any real programming language (Python being the closests)

- the experience of what coding is help us understand the formulation

- we look at the algorithm to understand computational cost and thus *scalability*


---

## Algorithm

A finite sequence of mathematically-rigorous instructions used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation

- mathematical rigour is for effective implementability on computers

- the sequence shall be executed *deterministically:* at each step we know exactly what the next step will be.


---

## Implementation 

Re-formulation of the algorithm in a specific programming language/version.

```python
def max1(data):
  '''Classical implementation of max for a sequence of integers'''

  M = 0
  
  for element in data:
    if element > M:
      M = element
  
  return M
```

incorrect on all-negative inputs:``max1([-1, -6, -3, -11])` returns 0.


---

## Another implementation

```python
def mymax(data):
  '''Robust implementation of classical max '''

  M = data[0]

  for element in data[1:]:
    if element > M:
      M = element
  
  return M
```

## Algorithmics

- discover new algorithms
  
- improve or re-pourpose existing ones

- provide bounds to the computational cost 
  
---

## Scalability

The suitability of an algorithm for deployment to cases with an increasing volume of data.

- Can our algorithm run over the `unimi.it` web pages within a minute or two?

- Can it scale up to the whole `.uk` domain, e.g., in an hour or two?

- Can it scale up to the whole *web,* e.g., in a day or two?


---

## Computational costs

Fact: scalability depends more on the intrinsic *complexity* of the problem than on the algorithm or the implementation.

Better implementation can contribute a scaling factor, e.g., 0.8, but cannot compress problem hardness

---

## Example: knapsack

The Fourty thieves' vault contains bars of precious metal

Each bar is described by weight and value

Bars can be cut to weight

![](https://worldstories.org.uk/content/book/823/__picture_7577.jpg)




---

Ali Baba breaks in, determined to steal as much value as he can

However, he can only carry away a fixed quantity of weight on his shoulders.

Help Ali Baba to carry away the most value


# Knapsack

---

## Formulation, I

__Instance:__

A description of weight and value of each bar

the maximum weight Ali Baba can take on his shoulders

__Solution:__

An allocation: for each bar says what quantity is taken, so as to maximise the overall stolen value

__Constraint__

The sum of all taken weights must not exceed what Ali Baba can carry 


---

## Formulation, II

__Instance:__

a sequence of *n* `weight/value` pairs (all non-negative int.): 

an integer C

__Solution:__

An allocation: for each bar says what quantity is taken

__Constraint__

The sum of all taken quantities must not exceed C

---

## An example with fruits

---

## Formulation, III

__Instance:__

a sequence of *n* `weight/value` pairs: $w_1, \dots w_n$ and $v_1, \dots v_n$

an integer C

__Solution:__

An allocation: for each bar says what quantity is taken: $\sigma: i \rightarrow [0..w_i]$

__Constraint__

The sum of all taken quantities must not exceed C: $\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma(i) \leq C$


---

## Further...

__Instance:__ $w_1, \dots w_n$, $v_1, \dots v_n$ and C
  
__Solution:__

- a selection function $\sigma: i \rightarrow [0..w_i]$

- let $\nu(i)$ be the val. of $\sigma(i)$ and find $\sigma = MAXARG_\sigma\{\sum_{i=1}^n \nu(i) \}$

__Constraints:__  $\sum_{i=1}^n \sigma(i) \leq C$


---

## Algorithm

Think of a step-by-step process that, for any input combination, will take the most value out of the vault

Write it down in English with some Maths

Test it on some examples, e.g.

| Metal     | Weight avail. | Total Val. |
|:----------|--------------:|-----------:|
| Palladium | 1             |         72 |
| Gold      | 3             |        162 |
| Silver    | 12            |         48 |
